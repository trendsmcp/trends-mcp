## FAQ

### What does AI trend research look like in practice?

You ask your AI: 'What is the trend momentum for electric bikes across search and social?' The AI calls Trends MCP's get_growth tool with source='all', receives normalized data from Google, TikTok, Reddit, YouTube, Amazon, and 7 more sources, and synthesizes a structured answer explaining which platforms are growing fastest, what the trajectory looks like, and what the data suggests about consumer interest.

### Which AI assistants can I use for trend research?

Any AI that supports MCP: Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Cline, Raycast, and others. Connect Trends MCP once and trend research is available in every session.

### How is this better than asking AI without live data?

Without Trends MCP, your AI can only reason about trends based on its training data -- which is months or years out of date. With Trends MCP connected, every answer is grounded in live data from today, not outdated training corpora.

### Can I automate trend research reports?

Yes. Use AI agents (Cursor Agent, Cline, Claude Code) to run automated trend research workflows -- daily or weekly trend reports, competitive monitoring, and content opportunity scans -- all powered by live Trends MCP data.
