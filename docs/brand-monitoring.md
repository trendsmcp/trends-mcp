## FAQ

### What brand signals does Trends MCP track?

Brand search volume (Google Search interest in your brand name over time), Reddit discussion volume (community conversation around your brand), news sentiment and volume (whether media coverage is positive, negative, or growing), social momentum (TikTok and YouTube mention trends), and web traffic trends for your domain.

### Can I track competitor brands at the same time?

Yes. Query multiple brand names in one session and compare growth trajectories. This is the core competitive benchmarking workflow -- your AI handles all the data retrieval and presents a comparison in whatever format you need.

### How is Trends MCP different from social listening tools?

Social listening tools (Brandwatch, Sprout Social) monitor individual mentions and comments. Trends MCP tracks aggregate volume signals -- how much total discussion, search, and media attention a brand is receiving and whether it is growing. Trends MCP is better for trend direction and momentum; social listening is better for individual mention analysis.

### Can I set up alerts for brand spikes?

Not as push alerts -- Trends MCP is a query-based tool. But you can ask your AI to check brand signals on a regular cadence and summarize changes. Pair it with a scheduling tool or AI agent workflow to automate monitoring.
