# Brandwatch alternative for AI assistants

## FAQ

### How does Trends MCP compare to Brandwatch?

Brandwatch provides granular social listening with post-level data, audience demographics, and customizable dashboards. Trends MCP provides aggregated trend signals -- volume and sentiment direction across platforms -- delivered to AI assistants without a dashboard. For teams that need trend intelligence without the enterprise social listening stack, Trends MCP covers the core use case.

### What social platforms does Trends MCP cover for brand monitoring?

Reddit (community discussion trends), Twitter/X (mention velocity), TikTok (hashtag and brand trends), YouTube (brand mention in video search), LinkedIn (professional discussion), and News (sentiment and volume across thousands of outlets).

### Can I set up automated brand monitoring with Trends MCP?

Yes. Use AI agent tools like Cline or Claude Code to run automated brand monitoring workflows -- daily or weekly brand health checks that query Trends MCP and send alerts when brand volume or sentiment changes significantly.

### Is this suitable for crisis monitoring?

Yes. News sentiment and Reddit data update continuously. A significant negative event typically appears in Trends MCP data within hours, giving teams an early warning window.
