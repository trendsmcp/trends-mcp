## FAQ

### What competitor signals does Trends MCP provide?

Web traffic trends (monthly visit trajectory via SimilarWeb estimates), brand search volume (Google Search interest in a brand name over time), social momentum (TikTok, Reddit, YouTube discussion volume for a brand), news sentiment and volume (is media coverage positive or negative, growing or shrinking), and app download trends (mobile user acquisition signals for app-based businesses).

### Can I compare multiple competitors side by side?

Yes. Query each competitor's domain or brand name and compare the results. A common pattern: give your AI a list of competitor domains, ask it to call get_growth for each on the webtraffic source, and return a ranked table sorted by traffic growth over the last 6 months.

### How accurate is the web traffic data?

Traffic estimates are sourced from SimilarWeb panel data and are directionally accurate for sites with over 50K monthly visitors. They are strong signals for competitive benchmarking but should not be treated as exact visit counts.

### Can I track brand sentiment changes after a competitor's product launch?

Yes. Query news_sentiment and news_volume for a competitor brand name and compare the period before and after a launch. Combined with web traffic and brand search trends, this gives a complete picture of how a launch affected their market position.
