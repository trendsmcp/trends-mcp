## FAQ

### What consumer signals does Trends MCP provide?

Search intent (Google, YouTube, Amazon -- what people are actively looking for), social interest (TikTok, Reddit, Twitter -- what people are engaging with and sharing), news coverage (sentiment and volume around topics), and web traffic trends (which brands and categories are gaining digital attention).

### How is this different from survey-based consumer research?

Surveys measure what people say they think. Trend data measures what people actually do -- what they search for, buy, watch, and discuss. It is faster, cheaper, and covers millions of data points instead of hundreds of survey respondents.

### Can I segment by geography?

Yes. Most sources support country and region filtering. Compare consumer interest in a product category between US, UK, Germany, and Japan in a single Trends MCP query.

### What industries find consumer insights most valuable?

CPG and FMCG brands tracking category demand, retail and e-commerce teams monitoring product interest, advertising agencies building media plans, and strategy consultants researching new market opportunities.
