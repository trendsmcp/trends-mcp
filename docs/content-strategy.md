## FAQ

### How can Trends MCP help with content strategy?

Your AI can: (1) compare keyword demand across TikTok, YouTube, and Google Search to find content format opportunities, (2) identify topics growing on TikTok before they reach Google Search (typically 2-4 weeks ahead), (3) validate whether a content idea has rising or falling audience interest, (4) generate a prioritized content calendar based on growth trajectory.

### Can I find TikTok trends before they go viral?

Yes. Use get_top_trends(source='tiktok') to see what is gaining momentum right now, or get_growth for specific keywords to check their daily trajectory. TikTok trends typically appear on Google Search 2-4 weeks later -- querying both lets you act early.

### Is Trends MCP useful for YouTube content strategy?

Yes. YouTube search volume data shows which video topics have growing demand. Compare a keyword's YouTube search volume against its TikTok hashtag volume and Google Search interest to understand where video content appetite is strongest.

### Can I track content performance of a specific topic over time?

Yes. Query the same keyword monthly and compare period-over-period growth to track whether a topic's audience interest is compounding, plateauing, or declining -- useful for deciding when to double down on a content series or pivot.
