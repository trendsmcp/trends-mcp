## FAQ

### What developer signals does Trends MCP provide?

npm weekly download counts (library and framework adoption velocity), Android app install trends via Google Play (mobile user acquisition growth), Steam concurrent player counts (gaming platform engagement), and web traffic trends for developer tools and SaaS products. All normalized and queryable via MCP.

### How is npm download data useful for investment or technology research?

npm downloads are a leading indicator of developer ecosystem adoption. A library growing consistently in weekly downloads is gaining mindshare before its commercial success is publicly visible. Investors and technology analysts use npm trends to validate whether a developer platform or toolchain is actually gaining traction.

### Can I compare multiple npm packages side by side?

Yes. Call get_growth for each package name and compare the growth rates. Common comparisons: React vs Vue vs Svelte, OpenAI SDK vs Anthropic SDK, Tailwind vs Bootstrap.

### Can I track a mobile app's growth without an app store developer account?

Yes. Trends MCP accesses Google Play install trend data via AppBrain estimates. Query by Android bundle ID (e.g. 'com.openai.chatgpt') and get normalized install trend data and growth rates without any app store credentials.
