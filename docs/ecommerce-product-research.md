## FAQ

### Which data sources matter most for e-commerce product research?

Amazon search volume (highest-intent purchase signal -- people on Amazon are ready to buy), Google Shopping (cross-retailer purchase intent), TikTok (viral demand that often predicts Amazon sales spikes 2-4 weeks ahead), and Google Search (broad consumer awareness). Together these four give a complete demand picture from awareness to purchase.

### Can Trends MCP help with dropshipping product research?

Yes. Query a list of product ideas across Amazon and TikTok. Products with rapidly growing TikTok hashtag volume but still-moderate Amazon search volume are early-stage opportunities -- high viral interest has not yet translated to saturated supply on Amazon.

### How far back does the product demand data go?

Up to 5 years of weekly data. This lets you distinguish genuine long-term trends from seasonal spikes or short-lived fads -- essential for deciding whether to build a product business around a category.

### Can I validate a product idea in one AI session?

Yes. A complete validation workflow: (1) Amazon demand growth, (2) Google Shopping purchase intent, (3) TikTok viral momentum, (4) Reddit community discussion, (5) 5-year Google Search trajectory. Your AI runs all five queries and synthesizes the results in one session.
