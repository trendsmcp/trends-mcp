## FAQ

### How is Trends MCP different from Exploding Topics?

Exploding Topics curates a database of hand-selected trending topics and surfaces them through a browsable interface. Trends MCP is a query tool: you ask about any keyword you choose and get live data back instantly across 12+ platforms. Trends MCP is for AI-agent workflows; Exploding Topics is for human browsing and discovery.

### Can I discover trending topics without knowing the keyword first?

Yes. Use get_top_trends(source='tiktok') or get_top_trends(source='google search') to surface what is rising right now across a platform without specifying a keyword -- similar to Exploding Topics' discovery mode but queryable by your AI in real time.

### Does Trends MCP have an API like Exploding Topics Pro?

Trends MCP delivers data via the Model Context Protocol, which is compatible with Claude, Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, and other AI clients. If you need raw API access for programmatic integration, contact us.

### Is Trends MCP better for investors or market researchers?

For AI-agent workflows, yes. Trends MCP covers platforms that Exploding Topics does not: Amazon purchase intent, Wikipedia information spikes, news sentiment, web traffic trends, app download signals, and npm developer ecosystem data -- all queryable by your AI agent in a single session.
