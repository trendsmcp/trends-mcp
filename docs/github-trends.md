## FAQ

### What developer trend data does Trends MCP provide?

npm weekly package downloads (the most reliable proxy for developer adoption), cross-referenced with Google Search volume for technology terms and Reddit discussion trends for developer communities. Together these give a complete picture of technology momentum.

### How is npm data more useful than GitHub stars?

GitHub stars are a vanity metric easily inflated by marketing campaigns. npm weekly downloads represent actual production usage -- developers who have chosen a package for a real project. Trends MCP surfaces download trends and growth rates, not just raw counts.

### Can I compare multiple frameworks at once?

Yes. Use get_growth with a list of keywords to compare, for example, 'react vs vue vs svelte' across npm, Google Search, and Reddit simultaneously.

### Who uses developer trend data?

CTOs and architects making technology stack decisions, VCs tracking developer tool adoption, technical content creators identifying trending topics, and developers evaluating which libraries to build on.
