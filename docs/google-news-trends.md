## FAQ

### What is Google News trend data?

Google News search volume reflects how many people are actively searching for a topic within Google News specifically -- a signal of breaking news interest rather than general information-seeking. It spikes sharply when a story breaks and declines as coverage fades.

### How is Google News data different from News Sentiment data?

Google News trend data measures search demand for a topic in the news context. News Sentiment data measures the tone (positive/negative) and volume of actual news articles published about a topic. Together they reveal both how much public attention a story is getting and whether coverage is favorable.

### Can I detect a breaking news story early with this data?

Yes. A sudden spike in Google News search volume often precedes the peak of broader Google Search interest by a few hours to a day. Combine with Wikipedia page view spikes for an early-warning signal stack.
