## FAQ

### What format does Google Search data come back in?

JSON with a time series array (date + normalized value + absolute volume), a summary object with growth metrics, and a data quality score indicating coverage reliability.

### Do I need a Google API key to use this?

No. Trends MCP handles all source connectivity. You connect once via the MCP config snippet and your AI can query Google Search data immediately.

### How accurate is the absolute volume estimate?

Volume estimates are derived from normalized Google Trends data combined with third-party search volume calibration. They are directionally accurate for trend analysis but should not be treated as exact query counts.

### Can AI agents use this data for market research?

Yes. A common pattern is: query a set of product or company keywords, rank them by search demand growth, and identify which has the strongest consumer interest signal.
