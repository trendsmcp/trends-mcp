## FAQ

### What is Google Shopping trend data?

Shopping search volume trends reflecting how often people search for products on Google Shopping specifically - a higher purchase-intent signal than general Google Search.

### How is Google Shopping data different from Amazon search data?

Google Shopping reflects cross-retailer purchase intent (people comparing products across many retailers). Amazon reflects intent to buy specifically on Amazon. Together they give a complete picture of consumer purchase demand.

### Is this useful for retail and e-commerce research?

Yes. Track which product keywords are growing on Google Shopping to identify demand shifts before they show up in sales data. Particularly useful for seasonal planning and new product category research.
