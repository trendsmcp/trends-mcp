## FAQ

### What trend data is most useful for content creators?

TikTok trending hashtags (what is getting views now), YouTube search volume (what people are watching), Google Search rising queries (what people are curious about), and Reddit discussions (what communities are engaged with). Trends MCP covers all four.

### How early can I catch a trend before it peaks?

TikTok trends typically lead Google Search by 2-6 weeks. Reddit discussions often precede TikTok by another week or two. By monitoring both TikTok and Reddit simultaneously via Trends MCP, creators can identify emerging content opportunities 3-8 weeks before they become obvious.

### Can I find trends specific to my niche?

Yes. Use get_top_trends or get_growth filtered to your content category. Many sources support category filtering -- technology, beauty, finance, gaming, food, etc.

### Can my AI suggest content ideas based on trend data?

Yes. Once Trends MCP is connected to your AI assistant, you can ask it to identify the fastest-growing topics in your niche this month and suggest content angles. The AI combines trend velocity data with its own knowledge to generate specific content ideas.
