## FAQ

### What alternative data signals does Trends MCP provide for investment research?

Web traffic trends (leading indicator of digital business revenue growth), Google Search brand interest (consumer awareness and demand trajectory), Reddit discussion volume (community and retail investor sentiment), News sentiment and volume (media coverage tone and intensity), Wikipedia page views (information-seeking spikes that often precede mainstream awareness), and Amazon/Google Shopping demand (consumer purchase intent for consumer-facing businesses).

### How can Wikipedia page views predict investment-relevant events?

Wikipedia page view spikes for a company or topic often occur 24-72 hours before the same event drives Google Search volume -- making them a leading indicator of public attention shifts. Sudden Wikipedia interest in a company can signal breaking news, regulatory events, or product launches before they reach full mainstream awareness.

### Can Trends MCP track website traffic as an investment signal?

Yes. Web traffic trends are a strong leading indicator for digital-first businesses -- consistent traffic growth ahead of earnings often correlates with revenue growth. You can compare traffic trajectories for a company against its peers in a single AI query.

### Is Trends MCP a replacement for Bloomberg or FactSet?

No -- it complements them. Bloomberg and FactSet provide financial fundamentals, filings, and price data. Trends MCP provides consumer-facing alternative signals: what people are searching for, buying, talking about, and clicking on. Together they give a more complete picture of business momentum.
