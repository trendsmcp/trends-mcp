## FAQ

### How do journalists use trend data for story discovery?

Monitor get_top_trends daily across Google, Reddit, and TikTok to surface topics gaining rapid interest. A Reddit thread gaining 300% discussion volume is often a story 48 hours before mainstream outlets cover it. Trends MCP gives you that early signal.

### Can I track whether a story is gaining or losing momentum?

Yes. Use get_growth for a topic with 1-week and 1-month comparisons to see whether interest is accelerating, stable, or fading. Useful for deciding whether to follow up on a story or move on.

### Can I track news sentiment for a topic?

Yes. The News Sentiment source returns positive/negative/neutral scores alongside volume. Track whether coverage of a topic is becoming more negative over time -- useful for spotting emerging controversies.

### Is this useful for data journalism?

Yes. Trends MCP provides quantified trend signals that can be cited in data journalism pieces: 'Search interest in X grew 340% over the past three months', backed by cross-platform data.
