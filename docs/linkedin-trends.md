## FAQ

### How does Trends MCP access LinkedIn data?

LinkedIn trends are derived from Google Search volume for LinkedIn-specific queries (using 'google search' as the source). LinkedIn does not offer a public trends API, so this signal reflects the volume of searches for professional topics associated with LinkedIn content and discussions.

### What is LinkedIn trend data useful for?

B2B content strategy, tracking which professional skills or technologies are gaining traction, monitoring competitor brand presence in professional contexts, and identifying emerging industry conversations.

### How does LinkedIn trend data differ from Google Trends?

LinkedIn signals reflect professional and B2B intent specifically. A keyword like 'supply chain automation' may have modest Google Search volume but strong LinkedIn trend signals, indicating strong B2B industry interest.
