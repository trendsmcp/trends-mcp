## FAQ

### What market research workflows does Trends MCP support?

Category sizing (how big and growing is demand for a product or topic), competitive analysis (comparing search momentum for competing brands or products), consumer demand validation (is interest rising or falling), trend forecasting (5-year historical trajectory to project future demand), and channel breakdown (which platforms are driving awareness).

### Can I use Trends MCP to validate a new product idea?

Yes. A typical workflow: (1) query Google Search and Amazon demand for the product category to measure consumer intent, (2) check TikTok and Reddit for community discussion growth, (3) review Wikipedia page views for information-seeking spikes, (4) compare against competitor brand search trends. Your AI assembles all of this in one session.

### How does Trends MCP compare to traditional market research tools?

Traditional tools give you reports. Trends MCP gives your AI live data it can reason over, synthesize, and present in any format you need -- a table, a summary, a competitive ranking -- without you leaving your AI conversation or exporting CSVs.

### Which data sources are most useful for market research?

Google Search (consumer intent at scale), Amazon (purchase intent specifically), TikTok (early-stage viral demand), Reddit (community and enthusiast interest), News Sentiment (media attention and tone), Wikipedia (information-seeking spikes), and Web Traffic (competitor site visit trends).
