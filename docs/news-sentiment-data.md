## FAQ

### What news data does Trends MCP provide?

Two signals: news volume (how much coverage a topic is receiving) and news sentiment (whether that coverage skews positive, neutral, or negative). Both are normalized and returned as time series.

### How is sentiment scored?

Sentiment is derived from NLP analysis of news article headlines and summaries, scored on a scale from -1 (strongly negative) to +1 (strongly positive). Trends MCP normalizes this to a 0-100 scale for consistency.

### Can I track sentiment for a company over earnings periods?

Yes. Query a company name or ticker and the sentiment series will show how media tone shifted around earnings announcements, product launches, or regulatory events.

### Which news sources are included?

Major English-language news outlets, financial media, and technology publications. The signal aggregates across sources rather than tracking individual outlets.
