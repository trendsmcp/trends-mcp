## FAQ

### What is news volume data?

A normalized signal representing how much news coverage a topic is receiving over time. High volume means lots of articles; low volume means the topic has dropped out of media attention.

### How does news volume differ from news sentiment?

Volume measures quantity of coverage. Sentiment measures tone. A company can have high news volume with negative sentiment (a crisis) or low volume with positive sentiment (quiet steady growth). Both signals together give a fuller picture.

### Can I detect media attention spikes in real time?

Yes. Use get_top_trends with source='news' to see what is spiking in news coverage right now, without specifying a keyword.
