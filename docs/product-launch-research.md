## FAQ

### How can I use trend data to validate a product idea?

Check the search trend for your product category using get_growth. If it is growing on Google and Amazon simultaneously, demand is building. If TikTok shows earlier-stage interest but Google has not caught up yet, you may have a launch timing advantage. Trends MCP gives you all three signals at once.

### Can I monitor the launch itself with Trends MCP?

Yes. After launch, use get_growth to track your product name or brand across Google Search, Reddit, YouTube, and News to measure launch momentum, PR coverage, and organic social spread.

### What signals indicate a good launch window?

Rising Google Search volume in your category (growing market), Amazon search volume increasing (transactional demand building), TikTok or YouTube content around your topic (organic creator interest), and News sentiment positive or neutral. Trends MCP surfaces all four in minutes.

### Can I research competitor launches too?

Yes. Track a competitor's brand name across Google, Reddit, and News to see how their launch performed. This gives benchmarks for what good launch momentum looks like in your category.
