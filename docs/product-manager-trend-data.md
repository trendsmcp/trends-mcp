## FAQ

### How can product managers use trend data for roadmap prioritization?

Search volume trends reveal which features and use cases are gaining user demand. Reddit discussion trends show what pain points your market is actively discussing. App download trends reveal which competitors are growing. Together, these give PMs an outside-in view that complements internal usage data.

### Can I validate a new feature idea with trend data?

Yes. Search for the feature concept or underlying user problem on Google and Reddit via Trends MCP. Growing search volume for the problem you are solving is the strongest external validation signal available.

### Can I track competitor product growth?

Yes. Monitor competitor product or brand names across Google Search, Reddit, and App Downloads to see whether they are growing in user awareness and adoption. Trends MCP surfaces growth momentum, not just static snapshots.

### What is the fastest query for PM research?

get_growth(keyword='your topic', source='all', percent_growth=['3M', '1Y']) gives a cross-platform trend picture in one call. Your AI can then synthesize the results into a prioritized summary.
