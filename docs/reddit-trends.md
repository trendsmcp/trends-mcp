## FAQ

### What Reddit data does Trends MCP provide?

Reddit discussion volume trends - normalized interest in a topic across the platform over time, including growth rate and historical time series. Not raw post counts, but a normalized demand signal calibrated for trend comparison.

### Is this useful for tracking community sentiment around a brand?

For volume signals, yes. Trends MCP shows whether discussion around a brand is growing or shrinking. For sentiment, the News source gives sentiment scores; Reddit gives pure volume context.

### Can I track a specific subreddit?

The current signal is platform-wide Reddit discussion volume for a keyword. Subreddit-level filtering is on the roadmap.

### How does Reddit trend data complement Google Trends?

Reddit often reflects niche, enthusiast, and early-adopter communities before topics reach mainstream Google Search. Comparing both reveals whether interest is still underground or going mainstream.
