# Semrush alternative for AI assistants

> Semrush is a powerful SEO tool, but it requires a dashboard, a login, and a four-figure annual subscription. Trends MCP takes a different approach: live trend and keyword data delivered directly to your AI assistant via MCP, without the overhead of a dedicated tool or the friction of manual report pulling.

## FAQ

### How does Trends MCP compare to Semrush?

Semrush is a full SEO platform with backlink analysis, rank tracking, site auditing, and keyword research. Trends MCP is focused specifically on trend intelligence: what is growing right now, across search and social, delivered to your AI. If you need trend signals for research and strategy without the full SEO stack, Trends MCP is significantly cheaper and integrates directly with your AI workflow.

### Does Trends MCP provide keyword difficulty or backlink data?

No. Trends MCP focuses on trend velocity and cross-platform momentum. It does not provide backlink analysis, SERP rankings, or site audit data -- those remain Semrush's domain. Trends MCP is best used alongside an SEO tool, not as a full replacement.

### What can Trends MCP do that Semrush cannot?

Trends MCP provides trend data across TikTok, Reddit, YouTube, Amazon, Wikipedia, News, App Downloads, Steam, and npm -- platforms Semrush does not cover. It also integrates directly with AI assistants via MCP, so your AI can act on trend data in real time rather than requiring you to manually pull and share Semrush reports.

### How much does Trends MCP cost compared to Semrush?

Semrush Pro starts at $140+/month. Trends MCP is priced as a data subscription significantly below that. For teams whose primary need is trend intelligence (not full SEO auditing), Trends MCP covers the trend research use case at much lower cost.
