## FAQ

### How does Trends MCP compare to SimilarWeb?

SimilarWeb provides detailed per-site metrics: exact visit estimates, traffic sources, engagement data, and market share analysis. Trends MCP provides trend direction: whether a site's traffic is growing or declining and how it compares to broader category trends. For trend intelligence without the full analytics stack, Trends MCP is significantly more accessible.

### What web traffic data does Trends MCP provide?

Traffic trend direction and velocity for websites: whether visit volume is growing, stable, or declining over 1-month, 3-month, and 1-year periods. This is the web traffic signal normalized and combined with search and social signals for a complete picture.

### Can I compare multiple competitor sites?

Yes. Query multiple competitor domains and compare their traffic trajectory. This gives a competitive landscape view without requiring SimilarWeb Enterprise access.

### Can I combine web traffic with other signals?

Yes. Cross-reference a competitor's web traffic trends with their Google Search brand volume and Reddit discussion trends to understand whether their traffic growth is organic, paid, or viral.
