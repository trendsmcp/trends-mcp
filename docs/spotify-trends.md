## FAQ

### How does Trends MCP access Spotify data?

Spotify trends are derived from Google Search volume for Spotify-related queries, as Spotify does not offer a public trends API. This reflects demand for specific artists, genres, or podcast topics within the Spotify context.

### What is Spotify trend data useful for?

Music industry research (rising genres, emerging artists), podcast content strategy (growing topic categories), audio advertising planning, and entertainment investment research where music or audio trends signal broader cultural momentum.

### Can I track a specific artist or podcast?

Yes. Query an artist name or podcast title and the signal shows whether search interest within Spotify contexts is growing or declining -- useful for tracking emerging artists before they chart.
