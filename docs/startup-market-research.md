## FAQ

### How can a startup use trend data to validate an idea?

Search for your core problem or solution on Google and Amazon via Trends MCP. Growing search volume means the problem is gaining awareness. Rising Amazon search volume means people are looking to buy a solution. Reddit discussion growth means the community is engaged. All three together signal a real market.

### Can I use Trends MCP to size a market?

Yes, directionally. Absolute Google Search volume estimates and Amazon product search volume give proxy metrics for market size and demand. Combine with web traffic data for competitor sites to estimate market scale.

### How do I track competitors as a startup?

Use get_growth with competitor brand names across Google Search, Reddit, and News. Track whether their brand awareness is growing faster or slower than yours, and identify which platforms are driving their growth.

### Is Trends MCP affordable for early-stage startups?

Yes. Trends MCP is designed to be cost-effective. Early-stage founders get access to the same multi-platform trend intelligence that enterprise research teams pay thousands for, at a startup-friendly price point.
