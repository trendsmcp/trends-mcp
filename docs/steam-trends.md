## FAQ

### What Steam data does Trends MCP return?

Normalized concurrent player count trends (0-100 scale) for any game on Steam. Returns weekly time series, growth rates, and peak player data. Useful for tracking game momentum before and after launches, updates, or sales events.

### How do I identify a game for the query?

Use the game's display name as it appears on Steam -- for example 'Counter-Strike 2', 'Palworld', or 'Elden Ring'. The MCP server resolves the name to the correct Steam App ID automatically.

### What is a concurrent player count?

The number of players actively in-game at the same time, tracked by Steam. Peak concurrent players (PCU) is a standard metric for measuring a game's popularity and live engagement level.

### How is this useful for investment or market research?

Game studios, investors, and analysts use Steam player trends to gauge a title's commercial momentum, identify breakout games early, and track how a game retains players over time.

### How far back does the data go?

Up to 5 years of weekly data, giving you full launch history, seasonal cycles, and long-term retention trends for any game on Steam.
