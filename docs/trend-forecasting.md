## FAQ

### How does AI trend forecasting work with Trends MCP?

Trends MCP provides the multi-platform signal data. Your AI (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.) can analyze growth acceleration across platforms, identify divergences (growing on TikTok but not yet on Google), and reason about which signals precede mainstream breakout. The AI does the pattern recognition; Trends MCP supplies the live data.

### Which data sources are the best leading indicators?

TikTok and Reddit typically lead Google Search by 2-6 weeks for consumer trends. GitHub and npm lead Google Search for developer trends. News volume spikes often precede Google Search peaks. Trends MCP lets you query all of these simultaneously to build a multi-signal leading indicator view.

### Can I track whether a trend is accelerating or plateauing?

Yes. Compare get_growth with different time windows (1M vs 3M vs 1Y) to identify whether a trend is in early acceleration, peak growth, or beginning to plateau.

### Who uses trend forecasting data?

Brand strategists identifying emerging categories, product teams validating new product ideas before launch, investors looking for early demand signals, content creators spotting topics before they get crowded, and market researchers building trend reports.
