## FAQ

### What sources does the trending topics API cover?

Google Search, TikTok hashtags, Reddit discussions, YouTube videos, Amazon products, Wikipedia articles, News stories, and more -- 12+ sources in total. Each returns the current top trending items with volume and growth signals.

### How does trending topics data differ from keyword search volume?

Search volume is historical and slow-moving. Trending topics captures what is spiking right now -- breakout queries that are growing 100%+ week-over-week. Trends MCP provides both: use get_top_trends for what is trending now and get_growth for measuring momentum over time.

### Can I filter trending topics by category?

Yes. Many sources support category filtering. You can request trending topics within specific categories like technology, finance, entertainment, or sports depending on the platform.

### How do I integrate this into an AI agent workflow?

Connect Trends MCP to your AI client (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.) and ask it to call get_top_trends. The agent receives a ranked list of trending topics with volume and growth data it can use for reporting, content planning, or further research.
