## FAQ

### Which platforms give the earliest trend signals?

TikTok (viral spikes appear 2-4 weeks before Google Search), Reddit (enthusiast and early-adopter discussion precedes mainstream awareness), Wikipedia (information-seeking spikes 24-72 hours before Google Search surges), and News Volume (media attention often precedes broader public discovery). Trends MCP covers all four in one query.

### How do I find what is trending right now without knowing the keyword?

Use get_top_trends(source='tiktok') or get_top_trends(source='google search') to surface what is rising right now across a platform. No keyword needed -- the API returns the current top trending topics and their growth rates.

### Can I compare a trend's trajectory across multiple platforms?

Yes. Query a keyword across TikTok, Reddit, YouTube, and Google Search and compare the growth curves. A trend growing fast on TikTok but still low on Google Search is early-stage. A trend peaking on Google Search but declining on TikTok is late-stage.

### How far in advance can Trends MCP detect a trend?

TikTok typically leads Google Search by 2-4 weeks. Reddit and Wikipedia can lead by 1-3 days for news-driven topics. The combination gives you a multi-layer early warning system across different trend cycle speeds.
