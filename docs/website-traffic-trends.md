## FAQ

### What is the difference between web traffic data and website traffic trends?

Web traffic data focuses on point-in-time volume. Website traffic trends focus on the growth trajectory over time - whether a site is gaining or losing audience momentum.

### Can I use this for investor research?

Yes. Website traffic trends are a leading indicator of business performance for digital-first companies. Consistent traffic growth ahead of earnings often correlates with revenue growth.
